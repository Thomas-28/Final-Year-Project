# Final-Year-Project

This repository contains a jupyter notebook which has all of the code that I wrote to produce the figures for my final year project titled "The Risk of Extinction
in Predator-Prey Systems Subject to Climate Variability." This project was carried out through the BSC in Mathematical Sciences degree at University College Cork
Ireland. 

My project involved the mathematical modelling of a predator prey species. We modelled chaotic climate variability using the Lorenz system and then 
coupled this with the predator prey system. The system then exhibited what is known as phase tipping, which we analysed.

The bifurcation diagrams for the predator prey model without climate variability were created in XPPAUT. 
We outputted the data from XPPAUT into three excel files, so they could be reproduced within the Jupyter Notebook.
The XPPAUT Data folder contains these excel files, and they will be required to run the notebook fully.
